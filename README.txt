Personal 
  - Game
      I made this a quite a few years back, mostly adapting the code from a tutorial for programming
      the game Asteroids in Java. Since I didn't have as much experience at that point,
      my commenting wasn't ideal, but it was mainly to help me with learing the language. The game just
      has the player trying to survive as enemies spawn at regular intervals to chase them.
			
      Shows my early interest in programming and game development.
			
  - CaptureRateCalculator
      This was a practical GUI application that I use for a Pokemon inspired tabletop game I play with
      my friends. The game requires a somewhat complex calculation when determining whether or not a 
      Pokemon is caught, so I figured I would just make a simple Swing application to do it for me. 
      I used this fairly regularly.
			
      Shows my ability to work with GUIs and to adapt to new technologies as I had no previous 
      experience with Swing before writing this.
			
  - PathfinderStats
      I regularly run Pathfinder 2nd Edition and that game has a lot of small bonuses to hit.
      I was interested in how much of a difference that actually made for the players. 
      The pure math is a little complicated because of how Pathfinder treats critical hits so 
      I just wrote a program to run simulations to calculate the stats instead. I found the 
      results pretty interesting. 
			
      This is the second verson of this application, where I cleaned it up for easier extensibility 
      and wrote it in C++ for practice and for better processing speed, since it involves a lot 
      of calculations to get accurate results.
			
      Shows my comfort with C++, the application of OOP principles and my ability to write maintainable
      and well-documented code. This is the most recent of all these projects.
	
Academic
  Data structure implementations from university projects.
  - Polymorphic BST
      Sample code from an implementation of a Polymorphic Binary Search Tree. We were provided with 
      the skeleton for PolymorphicBST.java
  - prio-q
      Priority queue implementation in C. 
			
      Shows ability to perform manual memory management when necessary.
			
  Both of these show my familiarity with common data structures.
